## Purpose

### Why stake TLOS for sTLOS?
- Staked sTLOS helps you put your staked TLOS to work in Defi and explore additional yield opportunities.
- Helps lock TVL on EVM enabling more attraction for investors and Dapps building on Telos. 

>   Disclaimer: Having sTLOS on the tEVM does not allow you to vote in governance processes (including block producers and worker proposals) - these are limited to the native network. Stake on Native to participate in Defi. Stake on EVM for receipt token and more yield opportunties. It's simple ask yourself this question: why am I staking? What is my defi play(have a plan), as there is a 3-5 day locking period.
